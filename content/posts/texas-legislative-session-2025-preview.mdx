The 2025 Texas Legislative Session is fast approaching, and organizations across sectors need to prepare for what promises to be a consequential period for state policy. Our government relations team has compiled this preview of key issues we anticipate will dominate the upcoming session.

## Budget Priorities

With projections indicating a budget surplus for the 2025-2026 biennium, we anticipate significant debate over spending priorities. Key areas likely to receive attention include:

- Infrastructure investment, particularly in grid resilience and rural broadband
- Public education funding formulas
- Healthcare accessibility initiatives
- Property tax relief measures

## Regulatory Focus

Several regulatory areas are positioned for possible reform:

- Energy regulation and market structure following ongoing reliability concerns
- Technology sector oversight, particularly regarding data privacy and artificial intelligence
- Healthcare delivery systems and telehealth permanence
- Environmental permitting processes, especially water usage in manufacturing and agriculture

## Industry-Specific Outlook

Based on interim committee hearings and stakeholder engagement, we predict the following industry-specific focus areas:

### Technology & Telecommunications

With broadband access now recognized as essential infrastructure, expect continued legislative attention on expanding deployment to underserved areas. Additionally, data privacy regulation modeled after other state frameworks appears increasingly likely.

### Healthcare

Healthcare workforce shortage solutions will be a major focus, along with measures to address rural healthcare access. Regulatory frameworks for new care delivery models are also expected.

### Energy

The legislature will continue addressing grid reliability with potential market structure reforms. Renewable energy incentives may face scrutiny, while natural gas infrastructure will likely receive support for resilience purposes.

## Strategic Recommendations

Organizations should consider these proactive steps in preparation for the 2025 session:

1. Engage with legislative offices during the interim to establish relationships and educate on key issues
2. Develop specific policy recommendations rather than general position statements
3. Build coalitions with aligned stakeholders to amplify advocacy efforts
4. Prepare data-driven impact analyses to support policy positions
5. Create a comprehensive government relations strategy with contingency plans for various scenarios
