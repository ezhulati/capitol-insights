# Telecommunications Regulatory Outlook for 2025

The telecommunications regulatory landscape in Texas continues to evolve rapidly, driven by technological innovation, changing consumer expectations, and shifting policy priorities. This analysis examines key regulatory trends that will impact telecommunications companies in 2025 and offers strategic considerations for effective policy engagement.

## State-Level Regulatory Trends

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment Framework Reforms

The Texas Legislature is expected to consider significant updates to the state's telecommunications infrastructure deployment framework in the upcoming session. Key areas of focus include:

- **Rights-of-Way Management**: Potential standardization of municipal ROW access fees and permitting processes to accelerate deployment
- **Pole Attachment Regulations**: Reforms to streamline the pole attachment process and potentially standardize rates
- **Small Cell Deployment**: Further refinements to small cell siting regulations, particularly for next-generation equipment
- **Dig Once Policies**: Expansion of coordination requirements for subsurface infrastructure projects

These reforms present both opportunities and challenges for providers, with the potential to significantly reduce deployment costs and timelines while potentially limiting local authority.

### 2. Universal Service Fund Evolution

The Texas Universal Service Fund (TUSF) continues to face funding challenges as traditional voice service revenues decline. The Public Utility Commission is exploring several potential reforms:

- Expansion of the contribution base to include broadband services
- Transition from revenue-based to connection-based contribution methodology
- Targeted support mechanisms focused on unserved and underserved areas
- Performance accountability measures for fund recipients

Providers should prepare for potential changes to both contribution obligations and eligibility requirements for support.

### 3. Consumer Protection Initiatives

Consumer protection remains a priority for both the Legislature and the Public Utility Commission, with several initiatives under consideration:

- Enhanced service outage reporting and customer communication requirements
- Expanded backup power mandates for critical network facilities
- Stricter enforcement of service quality standards
- New requirements for billing transparency and dispute resolution

These measures could impose significant operational and compliance costs if not carefully designed with industry input.

### 4. Broadband Office Implementation

The Texas Broadband Development Office continues to implement the state's broadband plan, with several regulatory implications:

- Coordination of state and federal funding programs
- Development of service quality and reporting standards
- Mapping and data collection requirements
- Digital inclusion and adoption initiatives

Effective engagement with the Broadband Office will be essential for providers seeking to participate in state-funded deployment programs.

## Federal Regulatory Considerations

While state policy remains our primary focus, several federal regulatory developments will significantly impact Texas telecommunications companies:

### 1. Universal Service Fund Reform

The FCC continues to evaluate comprehensive USF reform, with potential implications for:

- Contribution methodology and base
- High-cost support mechanisms
- Lifeline program eligibility and benefits
- E-Rate and Rural Health Care programs

These reforms could significantly affect provider economics, particularly in rural areas.

### 2. Spectrum Management

Federal spectrum policy continues to evolve, with several developments relevant to Texas providers:

- Reallocation of additional mid-band spectrum for 5G services
- Potential changes to unlicensed spectrum rules
- Spectrum sharing frameworks for federal bands
- Auction procedures for future spectrum releases

Access to sufficient spectrum resources remains critical for wireless providers' competitive positioning.

### 3. Net Neutrality and Broadband Regulation

The FCC's approach to broadband regulation continues to evolve, with potential implications for:

- Network management practices
- Interconnection arrangements
- Consumer privacy protections
- Service quality transparency

These policies could significantly impact network operations and business models.

## Strategic Considerations for Policy Engagement

Based on this regulatory outlook, telecommunications companies should consider the following strategic approaches:

### 1. Data-Driven Advocacy

Effective policy advocacy increasingly requires robust supporting data:

- Deployment economics and cost models
- Service availability and adoption metrics
- Investment and employment impacts
- Comparative analysis with other states

Companies should invest in developing credible, defensible data to support their policy positions.

### 2. Collaborative Engagement

Many regulatory issues benefit from industry-wide approaches:

- Trade association coordination on core policy priorities
- Strategic coalitions with adjacent industries
- Engagement with consumer advocates on areas of alignment
- Public-private partnerships for deployment initiatives

Identifying opportunities for collaborative engagement can amplify individual company influence.

### 3. Local Relationship Development

Despite the trend toward state preemption, local relationships remain critical:

- Proactive engagement with municipal officials
- Education on technology evolution and deployment requirements
- Development of model ordinances and agreements
- Demonstration projects showcasing benefits

Companies that invest in local relationships often experience fewer deployment challenges.

### 4. Regulatory Compliance Readiness

Given the evolving regulatory landscape, proactive compliance planning is essential:

- Monitoring of emerging requirements
- Cross-functional implementation teams
- Documentation and reporting systems
- Training and awareness programs

Early preparation for new requirements can reduce compliance costs and risks.

## Conclusion

The telecommunications regulatory landscape in 2025 will present both challenges and opportunities for industry participants. Companies that engage proactively, leverage data effectively, build strategic relationships, and prepare for compliance requirements will be best positioned to navigate this complex environment successfully.
