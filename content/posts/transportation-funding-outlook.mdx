# Transportation Funding Outlook: Preparing for the Next Budget Cycle

As Texas prepares for its next legislative session, transportation funding will once again be a critical focus area. This analysis examines the current landscape, emerging priorities, and strategies for stakeholders seeking to secure infrastructure investment.

## Current Funding Environment

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) operates with an annual budget of approximately $16 billion, derived from several sources:

- State fuel taxes (20 cents per gallon on gasoline, unchanged since 1991)
- Vehicle registration fees
- Proposition 1 (2014) oil and gas production tax diversions
- Proposition 7 (2015) sales tax and motor vehicle sales tax allocations
- Federal highway funds

While this funding base has provided stability, several factors are creating pressure for new approaches:

- Declining fuel tax revenue efficiency due to improved vehicle fuel economy
- Increasing construction and material costs outpacing revenue growth
- Growing maintenance needs for aging infrastructure
- Population growth demanding capacity expansion

## Anticipated Funding Priorities

Based on interim committee hearings, agency planning documents, and stakeholder engagement, we anticipate the following funding priorities in the upcoming budget cycle:

### 1. Rural Connectivity Initiatives

Expect increased focus on rural transportation networks, particularly:
- Farm-to-market road improvements
- Rural broadband corridor integration
- County bridge replacement programs
- Rural transit solutions

### 2. Urban Congestion Relief

Major metropolitan areas will continue to receive significant attention through:
- Managed lane expansions
- Interchange reconstructions
- Transit corridor development
- Intelligent transportation system deployments

### 3. Supply Chain Resilience

Recent supply chain disruptions have elevated the importance of:
- Port access improvements
- Intermodal connector enhancements
- Rail capacity expansions
- Border crossing infrastructure

### 4. Safety Enhancements

The state's Vision Zero initiatives will drive investment in:
- High-risk rural roadway redesigns
- Pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in urban areas
- Connected vehicle technology pilots
- Commercial vehicle safety enforcement

## Strategic Positioning for Stakeholders

Organizations seeking to secure transportation funding should consider these approaches:

### Data-Driven Advocacy

Successful funding requests increasingly require robust supporting data:
- Economic impact analyses showing return on investment
- Safety statistics demonstrating critical needs
- Congestion metrics quantifying time and productivity losses
- Environmental benefits including emissions reductions

### Regional Collaboration

Projects with multi-jurisdictional support receive priority consideration:
- Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) endorsement
- Council of Governments (COG) prioritization
- Multi-county coordination
- Public-private partnership structures

### Alignment with State Priorities

Projects should demonstrate clear alignment with TxDOT's strategic plan:
- Congestion reduction in urban areas
- Connectivity improvements in rural areas
- Safety enhancements in high-risk corridors
- Maintenance preservation of existing assets

### Alternative Funding Mechanisms

Beyond traditional allocations, consider exploring:
- Transportation Reinvestment Zones
- Tax Increment Financing districts
- Regional Mobility Authorities
- Federal discretionary grant programs

## Legislative Outlook

The upcoming legislative session may consider several policy changes that could affect transportation funding:

- Potential adjustments to the state fuel tax rate or structure
- Exploration of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) fee pilot programs
- Modifications to Proposition 1 and 7 fund allocations
- New local option funding mechanisms for transit and active transportation
- Electric vehicle fee structures to offset declining gas tax revenues

## Conclusion

Transportation funding decisions made in the next budget cycle will shape Texas infrastructure for decades to come. Organizations that prepare data-driven proposals, build regional consensus, and align with state priorities will be best positioned to secure necessary investments.
