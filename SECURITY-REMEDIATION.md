# Security Remediation Report for Capitol Insights

## Overview
This document outlines security vulnerabilities that were identified in the Capitol Insights codebase and the remediation steps taken to address them.

## Completed Remediation Actions

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Email Addresses from Server-Side Code
**Issue:** Email addresses were hardcoded in Netlify functions as fallback values.
**Risk:** Exposure of real email addresses to potential scraping and spam.
**Files affected:**
- `netlify/functions/contact-form-handler.js`
- `netlify/functions/lead-capture.js`

**Resolution:**
- Removed hardcoded emails
- Modified code to use environment variables exclusively
- Added validation to check if environment variables are set
- Now logging missing variables rather than exposing fallback values

### 2. Secured API Keys and Credentials
**Issue:** Cloudinary credentials were stored in the .env file and committed to version control.
**Risk:** Unauthorized access to Cloudinary account and potential misuse of services/billing.
**Files affected:**
- `.env`

**Resolution:**
- Removed credentials from the .env file
- Created a template .env.example file with placeholder values
- Verified .gitignore properly excludes .env files from version control
- Configured for Netlify environment variables usage instead

### 3. Implemented Input Validation and Sanitization
**Issue:** Form data was not properly validated or sanitized before processing.
**Risk:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, injection attacks, and submission of malformed data.
**Files affected:**
- `netlify/functions/contact-form-handler.js`
- `netlify/functions/lead-capture.js`

**Resolution:**
- Added the validator and xss npm packages
- Implemented proper email validation using validator.isEmail()
- Normalized email addresses using validator.normalizeEmail()
- Sanitized all user inputs with xss() to prevent XSS attacks
- Added URL validation for download links
- Enhanced error responses with more specific validation feedback

### 4. Strengthened Content Security Policy
**Issue:** Content Security Policy was too permissive, allowing unsafe inline scripts.
**Risk:** Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could inject malicious code that would be executed due to 'unsafe-inline' directives.
**Files affected:**
- `netlify.toml`
- `index.html`
- Moved inline scripts to external files

**Resolution:**
- Removed 'unsafe-inline' directive from the CSP in netlify.toml
- Created a CSP nonce generator for necessary inline scripts
- Moved structured data JSON to an external JavaScript file
- Created a utility to manage CSP nonces
- Relocated meta-fixer.js to a separate file in public/js/
- Updated the content security policy to use nonces rather than 'unsafe-inline'

## Required Next Steps

### 1. Rotate Compromised Credentials
ðŸš¨ **URGENT** ðŸš¨
- Log into the Cloudinary dashboard and regenerate API key/secret
- The following credentials should be considered compromised and MUST be rotated:
  - Cloud Name: dwnmuolg8
  - API Key: 293445685947373
  - API Secret: [REDACTED]

### 2. Configure Netlify Environment Variables
- Add the following environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:
  ```
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=[new-cloud-name]
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=[new-api-key]
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=[new-api-secret]
  FORM_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=byroncampbell@capitol-insights.com,[other-recipients]
  ```

### 3. Review Git History for Sensitive Information
- Review git commit history to identify any sensitive information that may have been accidentally committed
- If found, use git history rewriting tools to remove the sensitive information
- Force a repository push after cleaning to update all instances

### 4. Check Other Potential Security Issues
- Review the codebase for other hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Implement proper input validation in all form handlers
- Consider implementing rate limiting on form submissions to prevent abuse

## Security Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Never commit credentials to version control**
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Use .env.example files to document required variables without real values

2. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
   - Only grant the minimum necessary permissions to services and users
   - Regularly audit access and permissions

3. **Implement secure communication**
   - Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
   - Validate all server responses and handle errors securely

4. **Regularly rotate credentials**
   - Implement a regular schedule for credential rotation
   - Immediately rotate credentials when team members leave or security incidents occur

5. **Input validation and sanitization**
   - Validate all user inputs server-side
   - Sanitize data before storing or displaying it to prevent XSS attacks

## Verification Steps
After implementing the above changes, verify that:
1. Forms still work correctly with the new environment variables
2. No credentials are visible in the codebase
3. The application functions normally in all environments
