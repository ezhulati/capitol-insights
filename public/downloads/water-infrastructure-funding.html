      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>Texas faces critical water infrastructure challenges that require substantial investment and strategic policy approaches. This briefing provides a methodical analysis of the state's water infrastructure needs, current funding mechanisms, and legislative priorities for the upcoming 89th Legislative Session.</p>
      <p>Our analysis indicates that while Texas has established important funding frameworks through the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) and other programs, significant funding gaps remain, particularly for rural and economically disadvantaged communities. The 89th Legislature will need to address these challenges while considering the impacts of population growth, climate variability, and aging infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Key findings from this briefing include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Texas faces an estimated $80 billion in water infrastructure needs over the next 50 years</li>
        <li>Current funding mechanisms are insufficient to meet projected needs, particularly for smaller communities</li>
        <li>Aging infrastructure and climate variability are increasing the urgency for investment</li>
        <li>Federal infrastructure funding presents significant opportunities but requires state matching and coordination</li>
        <li>Regional disparities in water infrastructure capacity require tailored funding approaches</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Water Infrastructure Landscape in Texas</h3>
      <p>Texas's water infrastructure encompasses a complex network of systems for water supply, treatment, distribution, wastewater management, and flood control. This infrastructure is managed by a diverse array of entities, including municipal utility districts, river authorities, groundwater conservation districts, and local governments.</p>
      
      <h4>Current State of Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>The condition of water infrastructure varies significantly across Texas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Urban Areas:</strong> Major metropolitan regions generally have more robust systems but face capacity challenges due to rapid population growth and aging components</li>
        <li><strong>Rural Communities:</strong> Many smaller communities struggle with deteriorating infrastructure, limited technical capacity, and insufficient revenue bases</li>
        <li><strong>Border Regions:</strong> Colonias and other underserved areas along the Texas-Mexico border face particularly acute infrastructure deficiencies</li>
        <li><strong>Aging Systems:</strong> Approximately 35% of water and wastewater infrastructure in Texas is beyond its intended design life, leading to inefficiencies and reliability concerns</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Key Infrastructure Needs</h4>
      <p>The 2022 State Water Plan and other assessments identify several critical infrastructure needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Supply Projects:</strong> New reservoirs, groundwater development, aquifer storage and recovery, and water reuse systems</li>
        <li><strong>Treatment Facilities:</strong> Upgrades to meet evolving water quality standards and address emerging contaminants</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution Systems:</strong> Replacement of aging pipes and reduction of water loss through leakage</li>
        <li><strong>Wastewater Infrastructure:</strong> Treatment plant modernization and collection system improvements</li>
        <li><strong>Flood Control:</strong> Detention basins, channel improvements, and green infrastructure for stormwater management</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience Measures:</strong> Infrastructure hardening and redundancy to withstand extreme weather events</li>
      </ul>
