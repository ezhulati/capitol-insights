    <h1>Texas Transportation Funding Outlook (Continued)</h1>
    <h2>Analysis & Projections, 2025-2035</h2>
    <p class="author"><em>By: Drew Campbell & Byron Campbell, Capitol Insights</em></p>
    <p class="date"><em>March 2025</em></p>

    <h2 id="conclusion-continued">6. Conclusion (Continued)</h2>
    <p>The path forward requires a comprehensive transformation of how Texas funds transportation infrastructure. This transformation must balance several key considerations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Based Equity</strong>: Ensuring that those who use the transportation system contribute proportionally to its costs</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue Sustainability</strong>: Creating funding sources that grow with inflation, population, and economic activity</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation Feasibility</strong>: Designing systems that are administratively efficient and technologically viable</li>
        <li><strong>Political Acceptability</strong>: Developing approaches that can gain necessary legislative and public support</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Competitiveness</strong>: Maintaining infrastructure quality that supports Texas's continued economic leadership</li>
        <li><strong>Multimodal Integration</strong>: Addressing the full spectrum of transportation needs beyond highways alone</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The recommendations outlined in this analysis provide a framework for addressing these considerations through a combination of policy innovation, stakeholder engagement, and organizational preparation. By approaching transportation funding strategically rather than reactively, Texas can develop a sustainable system that supports its continued growth and prosperity.</p>

    <p>However, the window for action is narrowing. With Proposition 7 set to expire in 2034, electric vehicle adoption accelerating, and infrastructure needs growing, delay in addressing fundamental funding challenges will only increase future costs and complications. Leaders across public and private sectors must engage now in the challenging but essential work of transforming Texas transportation funding for the next generation.</p>
