    <p><strong>April Advocacy Strategy:</strong> Shift focus to floor strategies as bills move from committees to chamber consideration. Secure floor sponsors/handlers for amendments. Closely monitor the calendar and work with leadership offices to position priority legislation favorably. Begin preparing for conference committee scenarios on key bills. Intensify grassroots engagement on priority issues approaching critical votes.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Calendar - May 2025</h2>

    <p>May is the most intensive period of the legislative session, with numerous deadlines leading to the final adjournment. Conference committees work to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions of bills, and final negotiations on major legislation occur.</p>

    <p><strong>May Advocacy Strategy:</strong> Focus intensely on procedural strategy as deadlines approach. Work closely with authors/sponsors on conference committee strategy. Mobilize maximum stakeholder influence for final negotiations. Prepare for possible special session issues if major priorities fail to pass. Begin developing implementation strategies for successful legislation. Document lessons learned and relationship development outcomes for interim planning.</p>

    <h2>Post-Session Important Dates</h2>

    <p>After the regular session concludes, attention shifts to gubernatorial action on passed legislation and implementation planning.</p>

    <p><strong>Post-Session Advocacy Strategy:</strong> Monitor gubernatorial action on priority legislation. Begin engagement with implementing agencies as they develop rules and procedures. Cultivate relationships with legislative offices during the interim. Develop plans for interim committee testimony on priority issues. Prepare for possible special sessions if called by the Governor.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Planning Considerations</h2>

    <h3>The 24-Month Cycle Strategy</h3>

    <p>Success in the 140-day regular legislative session is largely determined by work done during the 18-month interim period before the session begins. Organizations that approach legislative advocacy as a continuous, two-year process consistently outperform those that engage only when sessions begin.</p>

    <h3>Critical Pre-Session Activities</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interim Committee Engagement:</strong> Participate in interim committee hearings addressing your priority issues</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship Development:</strong> Build and strengthen relationships with legislators and staff without immediate legislative demands</li>
        <li><strong>Issue Development:</strong> Refine policy proposals based on stakeholder input and technical analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Coalition Building:</strong> Establish formal or informal coalitions around shared policy objectives</li>
        <li><strong>Legislative Champion Recruitment:</strong> Identify and secure commitment from potential authors and sponsors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>In-Session Strategic Phases</h3>

    <p>The 140-day session naturally divides into distinct strategic phases, each requiring different approaches:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Organizational Phase (Days 1-30):</strong> Focus on relationship-building with newly appointed committee chairs and members</li>
        <li><strong>Committee Phase (Days 31-90):</strong> Concentrate efforts on securing hearings and favorable committee action</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar Management Phase (Days 91-120):</strong> Navigate the complex calendaring process to ensure floor consideration</li>
        <li><strong>Endgame Phase (Days 121-140):</strong> Manage amendments, conference committees, and final passage negotiations</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Post-Session Engagement</h3>

    <p>The conclusion of the regular session marks the beginning of important implementation work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Executive Action Monitoring:</strong> Track gubernatorial action on passed legislation</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation Planning:</strong> Engage with agencies as they develop rules and procedures</li>
        <li><strong>Interim Issue Development:</strong> Begin preparing for the next legislative cycle</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship Maintenance:</strong> Continue stakeholder and legislator engagement during the interim</li>
    </ul>
