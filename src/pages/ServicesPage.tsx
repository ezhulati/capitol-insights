                  question: "What makes Capitol Insights different from other government relations firms?",
                  answer: "Capitol Insights stands out through our measurable results approach, with an 85% success rate across 200+ client initiatives. Unlike firms that delegate to junior staff, our principals handle 100% of client work, resulting in 65% faster response times. We maintain a strict conflict management policy with a 0% conflict rate over 40+ years, and our data-driven strategies predict legislative outcomes with 95% accuracy."
                },
                {
                  question: "How long does a typical engagement last?",
                  answer: "Engagements vary based on objectives and legislative cycles. Our minimum engagement is typically one quarter, while comprehensive legislative campaigns usually span 6-12 months to allow for proper preparation and execution. Many of our clients have maintained continuous relationships for 5+ years to ensure ongoing policy influence and regulatory monitoring."
                },
                {
                  question: "Do you work with clients outside of Texas?",
                  answer: "Our primary focus and expertise are in Texas government relations, where we maintain relationships with 85% of legislative committee chairs. However, we do support multi-state clients with Texas operations and can refer to trusted partners in other states through our national network of government relations professionals."
                },
                {
                  question: "How do you measure and report on progress?",
                  answer: "We provide weekly metrics-based reports that quantify tangible progress on client objectives. Our reporting includes: 1) Specific actions taken and outcomes achieved, 2) Stakeholder engagement metrics, 3) Timeline updates with milestones, and 4) Data-driven analysis of legislative/regulatory developments. Clients receive comprehensive scorecards showing progress against agreed KPIs."
                },

                  question: "Can you guarantee specific legislative outcomes?",
                  answer: "While our 85% success rate demonstrates consistent effectiveness, we never guarantee specific legislative outcomes, as policy-making involves many variables beyond any firm's control. Instead, we promise ethical representation, strategic guidance, transparent reporting, and our best professional efforts. We're known for our realistic assessments and clear communication about what is achievable."

                  question: "What information do you need to get started?",
                  answer: "To begin an effective engagement, we typically need: 1) A clear understanding of your organization and industry, 2) Your specific policy objectives and priorities, 3) Current challenges and opportunities in the regulatory landscape, 4) Key stakeholders within your organization, 5) Previous government relations efforts and outcomes, and 6) Timeline and budget parameters for the engagement."
